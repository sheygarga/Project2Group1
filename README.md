# State of the Sun

Our initial objective:
Provide the user an opportunity to explore the “good” and the “bad” side of the sun across the US at a state-level. The primary focus is the “good”: solar project completion by state and associated metrics, including visualization of correlations by metric (e.g., system size vs. cost). The “bad” component is a review of skin cancer rates by state.

Objective updates:
Data source NREL reporting of installation costs is very inconsistent. We are unable to provide related analysis as a result.

Related topics we might explore in the future: 
Visualize installations over time.
Explore additional relationships such as installation by sector, proxies for solar resource, and state policies/programs.
